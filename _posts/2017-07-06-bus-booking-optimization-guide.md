You're probably thinking --- I didn't even think booking buses _could_ be optimized. In fact they can! ðŸ˜€

## I. Use Wanderu!
[Wanderu](https://www.wanderu.com/en/){:target="_blank"} is the Google of bus tickets --- it pulls and sorts options from all major bus providers so you can identify the best ride across a 100 options instead of the 10 proprietary options the Greyhound/Megabus/Boltbus site provides.

On top of that, you can:
* Sort the options for the cheapest/fastest/shortest route
* Select specific carriers
* Include nearby cities
* Adjust the time slider to identify only the buses which leave after a certain time or arrive by a certain time. 

Once you've found a bus, you can either:

* Pay through the site (100% free as of July 2017).
* Navigate to the company site and book there.

While I personally find Wanderu the most versatile, another great option is [BusBud](busbud.com){:target="_blank"}.

## II. Booking multiple dates 1-3 months in advance may be cheaper than booking a single date the week of travel.

Say youâ€™re traveling from Philadelphia to New York on a weekend 3 months in the future, though youâ€™re not sure which weekend.

1. Check the prices for this weekend, to get a sense of what the cost of a last-minute booking is. 

2. Check the prices for 1-3 months out.

3. If the prices of a ticket 1-3 months out is significantly cheaper (say $1-5 instead of $20-$30) buy multiple tickets for a couple weekends.

Depending on the route, this can actually be _way_ cheaper than booking last minute. If you do this through Megabus, you can later credit the unused tickets to a future trip. 

## III. Snag overnight trips if you can.

Since youâ€™ll be asleep a majority of the time, you wonâ€™t even realize how much time youâ€™ve been on the bus. Plus, you avoid paying for a hotel that night. ðŸ˜‰

## IV. If you travel often, play the rewards game.

Yes, they're irritating to sign up for, but if you travel often (for example if you're a college student), being strategic about your trips and using rewards programs can pay off. 

### Boltbus Rewards
Take 8 trips, get 1 free =)

### Greyhound Rewards

|:--------:|:-------:|:--------:|
| Book    | Reward    |
|:--------:|:-------:|:--------:|
| 3 roundtrip tickets   | 15% off next ticket   | Buy 1 get 1 free for a friend   |
| 5 roundtrip tickets   | 20% off next ticket   | Buy 1 get 1 free for a friend   |
| 8 roundtrip tickets   | Free trip anywhere   |    |

The best strategy here is to first use [Wanderu](https://www.wanderu.com/en/){:target="_blank"} to figure out which bus carrier offers the cheapest price consistently for your route. Once you find a carrier, use that carrier exclusively and join their rewards program; most of these reward programs require a good number of rides to reap the benefits. Companies like Greyhound and Boltbus offer free rides and rewards with every 8 rides you buy. 

Say you're a college student, and between the months of August and May, you return home on a $20 bus ride for Thanksgiving, Christmas, Spring Break, and Fall Break (8 roundtrips -- a total of 32 roundtrips and 64 individual trips over 4 years). __With a Boltbus or Greyhound rewards program, you end up saving $160 with 8 free trips__. Not too shabby!
