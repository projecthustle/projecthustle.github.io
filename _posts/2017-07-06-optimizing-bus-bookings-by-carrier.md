## If itâ€™s imperative your bus arrives on time. . .

__Avoid Megabus and aim for Boltbus (first choice) or Greyhound/Peter Pan.__

Discount buses are _all_ likely to be late. Thatâ€™s simply the nature of the sector. For every carrier, youâ€™ll find hordes of people who can attest to a late bus. 

Personally, when Iâ€™m tight on time, I never book Megabus and exclusively opt for Boltbus and maybe Greyhound/Peter Pan if the price difference is that great. In my experience, Megabus has had a delay (defined as any departure 30 minutes or later than the stated time) about 40% of the time, but does tend to have cheaper prices. With Boltbus, I've never had a departure that was more than 30 minutes late. Greyhound has been somewhere in the middle for me. 

## If you have way over-sized baggage or too many bags. . .

__Avoid Greyhound,Peter Pan, and Megabus, and opt for Boltbus.__

Greyhound is incredibly strict on their baggage policies and is _far_ more likely to charge you for excess luggage items/size/weight. 

Boltbus has you load the luggage in yourself so they donâ€™t even notice your luggage count or weight.

Megabus has an operator load the luggage and does complain if itâ€™s overweight, but isnâ€™t as formal as Greyhound in terms of weighing the luggage.  

## If you are likely to miss your bus or might need to re-schedule the date/time. . . 

__Avoid Greyhound and opt for Megabus or Boltbus.__

Greyhound requires a flat $20 re-booking fee for changing the date or time of a ticket or re-booking a ticket if youâ€™ve missed your bus and need to get on the next one. If you need to re-schedule in advance of the booking, Megabus allows you to credit the cost of your previous booking to a new booking, minus a $3 re-booking fee. Pretty sweet! Boltbus is also pretty lenient about re-bookings as [customers explain](http://ask.metafilter.com/135905/Boltbus-Refund-Question){:target="_blank"} theyâ€™ve been able to receive credit or an exchange for a ticket. 

## If you like to arrive fashionably late for your buses. . .

__Avoid Greyhound/Peter Pan and Boltbus which tend to leave on the dot, and opt for Megabus which is often delayed.__

LOL.

## If you want free wifi. . .

Get a train. The wifi is pretty crappy on all bus carriers. ðŸ˜›
