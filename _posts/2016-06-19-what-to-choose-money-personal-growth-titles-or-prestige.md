Consider yourself a graduating senior; after having gone through a bunch of interviews, you have offers from a startup, a finance firm, a prominent technology company, and an opportunity to pursue a masters. Naturally these offers come with different benefits; one may help you build your human capital while another might throw tons of money your way. **Which do you choose? More generally, what should one prioritize: money, personal growth, titles, or prestige?**

In [Startup of You](https://www.amazon.com/gp/product/0307888908/ref=as_li_tl?ie=UTF8&camp=1789&creative=9325&creativeASIN=0307888908&linkCode=as2&tag=amazon05b3-20&linkId=759863cb7d22362f4acdbf7144bffa30){:target="_blank"}, Reid Hoffman (founder of LinkedIn), argues an individual has two types of career assets, hard and soft. Soft assets refer to intangible skills and elements of your success; your professional connections, the knowledge you have, your skills, your clubs, the trust and reputation you’ve built, etc.

Hard assets refer to tangible and countable financial and physical possessions; one’s stock market portfolio, the money in one’s bank account, laptops, cars, etc., – whatever might contribute to one’s net worth. They’re important in the sense that having a good amount of hard assets gives one flexibility to build and advance one’s soft assets – for example, taking 6 months off to learn web development or marketing skills. 

Hoffman points out that absolutely *inarguably*, college grad should focus on developing their soft assets: 

> > “Unfortunately, for far too many, focused learning ends at college graduation. They read about stocks and bonds instead of reading books that improve their mind. They compare their cash salary to their peers' instead of comparing lessons learned. They invest in the stock market and neglect investing in themselves. They focus, in short, on hard assets instead of soft assets. This is a mistake. . .[P]rioritize plans that offer the best chance at learning about yourself and the world. Not only will you make more money in the long run, but your career journey will be more fulfilling. Ask yourself, “Which plan will grow my soft assets the fastest?” Even simpler: “Which plan offers the most learning potential?”
 
So Hoffman is quite clear in his emphasis of personal growth over money, titles, and other forms of hard assets. 

He isn’t alone. Writers like computer science professor Cal Newport have dedicated entire books to the notion of cultivating one’s skill, particularly for recent college grads. In [So Good They Can’t Ignore You](https://www.amazon.com/gp/product/1455509124/ref=as_li_tl?ie=UTF8&camp=1789&creative=9325&creativeASIN=1455509124&linkCode=as2&tag=amazon05b3-20&linkId=f9237c07380551d2e25ff3b638ef4897){:target="_blank"}, Cal argues you become truly successful when you spend years and years, hours upon hours, cultivating your skillset. 

He argues the best work opportunities are awarded to those who’ve built up ‘career capital’, the rare and valuable skills one develops over time. Career capital is developed over years of deliberate practice. He emphasizes adopting a ‘craftsmen mindset’ towards work, focusing on producing the best outcome and working tirelessly to improve one’s craft.

In this sense, Newport argues a focus on personal development is not just a priority, but vitally necessary in achieving career success. With that, he argues, the rest – titles, promotions, money, and prestige, will follow. Easier said than done, in my opinion, but still pretty worthy advice.
