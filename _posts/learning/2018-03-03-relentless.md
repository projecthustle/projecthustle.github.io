## Book Summary
* Relentlessness is a state of _always_ driving to be the best, achieving that, then pushing to a whole new level, even if that level doesn't exist. 
* You're not competing with anyone; you're constantly outperforming yourself, as the competition studies _you_. 
* Relentlessness involves trusting your instincts and not being swayed by others second-guessing your process or potential for success. 
* People who are relentless put in the work day in, day out, even when the competition isn't.

## Insights 

<p style=" font-size: 18px; font-weight: bold; ">1. Prevent People's Doubts From Becoming a Self-Fulfilling Prophecy</p>

> When you’re listening to a mess of external directions, you’re going to end up trying a million little things, without complete confidence that any of them will work. 
>
>  When I decided to get a degree in kinesiology, everyone said, “Oh, you’re going to be a gym teacher?” No, I’m going to train pro athletes. “You can manage a health club!” No, I’m going to train pro athletes.
> 
> __There is zero chance you’ll get anywhere if you allow yourself to become paralyzed by soft excuses and countless reasons why you’ll never get to where you want to be.__ 
> Trust your gut to navigate the hard road to get there. 

People will always second-guess your intentions & potential for success if you do anything the least bit extraordinary.

Trust yourself in those moments.

<p style=" font-size: 18px; font-weight: bold; ">2. Reframe Stress</p>

> Not everyone gets the opportunity to be stressed by the potential to achieve exceptional things.

What a beautiful reframing. He's right. The big things we're achieving in life, the projects we work on, the schools we attend - as stressful as they are, they are _a privilege._

---
<p style=" font-size: 18px; font-weight: bold; ">3. We're Born Relentless</p>
We're born relentless and taught to relent as we grow up. In other words, we lose our natural drive & ambition to fit into societal norms & external pressure. But that inner drive is there, if you're willing to tap into it.

---
<p style=" font-size: 18px; font-weight: bold; ">4. On Failure</p>
When people say you've failed, what they really mean is that, they, in your shoes, would feel like a failure. 

But you're not them. You stop when you _decide_ to stop, when you say it's over.

## Personal Opinion
I read ~1-3 books a month and it's pretty rare for me to identify a book as being *really, really* bad. 

_Dear God this was so bad._

The _idea_ behind the book is great and incredibly motivating. But Tim Grover's book on achieving this state is so bad, it's almost comical. He does the arrogant, self-help-y thing of describing a set of "weaker people" and a set of "ideal people", defining arbitrary definitions of them (which, of course, he's clear to point out also describe himself), and suggesting most all successful people fit this arbitrary mold of self-centered, macho, go-getter type personalities. 

Don't get me wrong: We all should be relentless in one way or the other. But Grover's book is just a really bad way of getting this point across - with a lot of fluff and not much to show for it. 

The book's novel content could probably be condensed to ~5% of the number of pages, and the quality content to perhaps ~10% of the number of pages. 

__If you feel complacent in your life:__ Listen to it at 2x speed (~2.75 hours) while doing errands so you don't waste time, but still get the message. Otherwise, definitely not a cover-to-cover read.
