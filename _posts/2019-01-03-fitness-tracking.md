They say what can be measured can be managed. 

As of December 2018, I started gathering more meticulous data on my exercise habits to:

* Truly see progress via hard data
* Shame myself out of natural couch potato-ness by publicly posting the numbers ðŸ˜›

Let's see if it works! I'll keep track of my numbers daily and post them every 1-2 months.
