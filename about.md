## About the Site

Welcome to Project Hustle! 

Everyone has a hobby. My hobby is side-hustling and working on life projects - challenges designed to finish within a set period of time. 


## Site Origins

In September 2015, I published [The Official Couchsurfing Guide]({% post_url 2015-06-02-beginners-guide-to-couchsurfing %}){:target="_blank"} which went viral within the Couchsurfing community. 

Now, back to a modest 10-20 daily visitors, this site is focused on exploring various life projects - from giving TEDx talks to getting fit. 

Welcome, have fun, and if you see something you like, feel free to email me ({{site.email}})! I love meeting & connecting with people. I live in Dallas, TX + love meeting people so if you're in the area, reach out.

### I spend a lot of time thinking about

__Personal Development__ -- I consider myself a constantly evolving piece of software - continually identifying the bugs and feature implementations I can add to myself and the million things I have yet to learn. Reid Hoffman terms this state ‚Äúpermanent beta‚Äù, which I *entirely* identify with.

Sometimes a feature gets added and the whole thing blows up (cue Stack Overflow), but for the most part, it‚Äôs worked out pretty well. I can't imagine not being obsessed about personal development, what I can learn, and how I can improve; it comes with its ups and downs but for the most part, I'm incredibly proud of how far I've come and more importantly, how much further I have to go from here.

__Optimizing / Engineering Life__ . . .as opposed to simply letting it happen.

__Future Plans / Future Trajectory__ . . . or in other words, how to maximize the impact and value I provide in my chosen career path.
