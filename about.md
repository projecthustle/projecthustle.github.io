## About

My name is Neha -- welcome to Project Hustle! 
 
Everyone has a hobby. My hobby, broadly speaking, is exploring various life projects and challenges in an attempt to improve myself -- from technical skills to fitness challenges.

This site is dedicated to exploring these projects, learnings, and musings. 

### Let's Chat

I'm always happy to hear from folks and if you're in the Bay Area, always happy to meet up for coffee.

### Education

I graduated from Johns Hopkins University and also studied briefly at Oxford University as a visiting student. 

While at university, I double majored, double minored, though mostly focused on economics and computer science. 

### Year Off

After 16 years of trying _way_ too hard, I decided to defer my job offer and take a year off to focus on self-developmental goals other than pure academics, including:
* Solo-backpacking 30 countries
* Vipassana 10-day, 10 hr/day meditation course
* Fitness (Insanity/P90x)
* Entrepreurial side hustles

### Microsoft

These days I work at Microsoft as a Cloud Infrastructure Consultant -- in other words, serving as a technical resource building cloud infrastructure and automation solutions for Microsoft's enterprise customers. 

### Small Business

I've always had a deep love of entrepreneurship, growth strategy, and system-building. On the side, I run a small business with ~10 part-time employees and ~30 clients. While I develop my technical skill at Microsoft, this side business has been a fun outlet for that extra, entrepreneurial energy.


## Interests

Broadly speaking, I spend a lot of time thinking about ways of improving myself

__Personal Development__ | Broadly speaking, I spend a lot of time thinking about personal development. I consider myself a constantly evolving piece of software - continually identifying the bugs and feature implementations I can add to myself and the million things I have yet to learn. Reid Hoffman terms this state “permanent beta”, which I *entirely* identify with. <br><br>Sometimes a feature gets added and the whole thing blows up (cue Stack Overflow), but for the most part, it’s worked out pretty well. I can't imagine not being obsessed about personal development, what I can learn, and how I can improve; it comes with its ups and downs but for the most part, I'm incredibly proud of how far I've come and more importantly, how much further I have to go from here.
__Optimizing Processes__ | As opposed to simply continuing with the status quo.
__Future Plans & Trajectory__ | In other words, how to maximize the impact and value I provide in my chosen career path.
